# Obsidian Snippets

This is my space to upload useful snippets for my Obsidian. I am currently using the **Obsidianite** theme and will be regularly uploading utility `.css` files as I create them based on my needs.

## How to Use the Snippets

1. Open Obsidian and go to **Settings**.
2. Navigate to the **Appearance** section.
3. Click on **CSS Snippets**.
4. Click on **Open snippets folder**.
5. Copy the `.css` files from this repository into the opened folder.
6. In **Settings**, activate the snippets you need.
